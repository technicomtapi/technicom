                  The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is a tool to assess the technology development stage for a particular application. 
                  A particular level is achieved if the prescribed activities for that level are accomplished. 
                  The movement of technology through the scale tracks the technology development stage 
                  (whether it’s an idea, proof of concept, component, system, etc.) and the environment where it is tested 
                  (laboratory, a simulated operational environment, actual environment, etc.). <br><br>

               <p>
                  <b>APPLICATION STEPS:</b><br><br>

                  1. The project proponent prepares a full-blown proposal 
                  along with the complete requirements. <br><br>
                  - The project proponent may attend any of the scheduled TechnoBYAHE sessions, 
                  which are announced on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DOST.TAPI" target="popup" class="links">DOST-TAPI's Facebook Page</a>. 
                  A TechnoBYAHE session is DOST-TAPI's event to orient on its Technopreneurship Programs, 
                  including the TECHNiCOM Program. <br><br>

                  2. The project proponent sends a copy of the full-blown 
                  project proposal and the complete requirements via email to 
                  <a href="acu.tapi@gmail.com" target="popup" class="links">acu.tapi@gmail.com</a>. 
                  The Applied Communications Unit for Non-inventors (ACU-n) shall provide feedback 
                  regarding the proposal's and requirements' completeness. <br><br>
                  - The project proponent may also send a draft proposal to 
                  <a href="acu.tapi@gmail.com" target="popup" class="links">acu.tapi@gmail.com</a> 
                  to schedule a one-on-one consultation or writeshop session. <br><br>

                  3. The project proponent shall also simultaneously send the full-blown proposal 
                  to the DOST Regional Office* to request a positive endorsement based on the initial 
                  evaluation of the project TRL. <br><br>
                  - Please allow the DOST Regional Office two (2) weeks to issue an endorsement. 
                  The proponent should ideally request the endorsement well ahead of the Call for 
                  Proposals deadline to ensure a complete set of requirements. <br><br>

                  4. Once the proponent revises the proposal based on the ACU-n's feedback and 
                  completes the requirements, including the DOST Regional Office endorsement, 
                  the proponent submits these via the DOST Project Management Information System (DPMIS) 
                  through this link: <a href="http://dpmis.dost.gov.ph" target="popup" class="links">http://dpmis.dost.gov.ph</a>. <br><br>
                  - The DPMIS shall close after the indicated Call for Proposals deadline. 
                  The evaluation period shall begin after the Call for Proposals deadline. <br><br>
                  
                  5. During the evaluation period, the DPMIS shall forward the submitted proposals to DOST-TAPI. 
                  The DOST-TAPI shall inform the project proponent, through the contact information provided, 
                  regarding the status of his/her proposal. <br><br>
                  - During the evaluation period, the project proposal will undergo further revisions. 
                  The proponent is expected to closely coordinate with the TECHNiCOM Program Unit for 
                  further revisions and the next evaluation steps. <br><br>
